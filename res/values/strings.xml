    <string name="about_full">
        The Dual Battery Widget was initially created for the Asus Eee Pad Transformer,
        a device that has a second battery in the dock station. Unfortunately, the standard Android tools
        do not provide any way of displaying the status of a second battery, so this widget was created
        to fill this gap. \n
        \n
        The author of this widget is Artiom Chilaru, and it was initially posted on the xda-developers forum.
        It is distributed for free on the Android Market. If you paid for it, or downloaded it from any other place,
        I would strongly recommend uninstalling your copy, and installing it from the market. This way you can make
        sure that your copy has no malware attached to it, and you will get free updates to the latest version
        as soon as it\'s released!  \n
        \n
        <b>Note:</b> <u>If you use a custom rom</u>, there is a high chance that this widget will not be able to identify
        the dock status, or even register that your device supports it at all.. This is a restriction of most custom
        kernels at this moment, not of this application. \n
        This is because Asus extended their Android kernel build to send extra information about the dock and the
        dock battery along with battery status notifications. Unless this change has been merged in the custom kernel,
        it will not be sending these notifications \n
        \n
        You can install the widget from the marketplace here:

    <string name="kernelAlert_title">Important!</string>
    <string name="kernelAlert_message">
        Oops, it seems like you\'re running a custom built kernel.
        Unfortunately, as far as I know, only a small number of them currently broadcast the dock battery status. \n
        Until they migrate this part of the kernel from the standard Asus kernel, getting this information isn\'t quite possible :( \n
        \n
        The widget will still display the main battery battery, and there\'s still some chance that it will see the dock battery too...
