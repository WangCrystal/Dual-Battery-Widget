<b>IMPORTANT!</b> It is possible that the widget will not immediately appear in the widget list after installation. To refresh the widget list, you should either restart your device (long press the power button and shut down, the start again), or restart the launcher app (Settings -> Applications -> Manage applications -> All -> Launcher -> Force stop).
Do this after installing the widget, then go to your home screen, tap the "+" in the top right corner of your screen, go to the widgets tab, and scroll to the right. You will find the widget there. <br />

This is a Battery Widget that displays the status for the internal battery, and the secondary battery in your dock station. It is mostly intended for the <b>Asus Eee Pad Transformer</b> tablet (which is the only device that currently reports the dock battery life). All other devices will only show the main battery icon.

The widget is resizable, and can be as little as 1 cell on your screen, or fill your whole home screen! Advanced options allow you to change the size and the position of the status text, and hide the second battery gauge when it is disconnected.

It will also store the battery history and display the stored values in a chart for later review.

Any feedback is welcomed!
If you have a device that has access to a secondary battery, but this widget does not identify it, drop me an e-mail with the device model, so that I can add support for it.
